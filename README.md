RP2040

August 5, 2023

Here you have various experiments and projects involving the Pi Pico and
the RP2040 chip.

I was never a great fan of the Raspberry Pi, but the Pico and RP2040 are
another thing entirely.  The more I work with them, the more I like them.
Everything is open source, even the bootrom code.
